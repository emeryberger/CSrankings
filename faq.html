			    Rankings are intensely popular and
			      influential. While we might wish for a
			      world without rankings, wishing will not
			    make rankings go away.
			  </p>
			  <p>Given this state of affairs, it makes
			      sense to aim for a ranking system that
			      is meaningful and transparent. Unfortunately, the most influential
			      rankings right now are those from US
			      News and World Report, which is entirely
			      reputation-based and <a target="_blank"
			      href="http://www.usnews.com/education/best-graduate-schools/articles/science-schools-methodology">relies
			      on surveys sent to department heads and
			      directors of graduate studies.</a>
			  </p>
			  <p>
			    By contrast, CSRankings is entirely
			    metrics-based: it weighs departments by
			    their presence at the most prestigious
			    publication venues. This approach is
			    intended to be both incentive-aligned
			    (faculty already aim to publish at top
			    venues) and difficult to game, since
			    publishing in such conferences is
			    difficult. It is admittedly bean-counting,
			    but its intent is to "count the right
			    beans." It is also entirely transparent;
			    all code and data are publicly available
			    at <a href="https://github.com/emeryberger/CSRankings">

			    Unfortunately, citation-based metrics have
			    been repeatedly shown to
			    be <a target="_blank"
			    href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.0638">subject</a>
			    to <a target="_blank"
			    href="http://evaluation.hypotheses.org/files/2010/12/pdf_IkeAntkareISSI.pdf">manipulation</a>. There
			    are <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/2017/08/22/one-way-boost-unis-ranking-ask-faculty-cite/">universities
			    instructing faculty</a> to cite each
			    other, and the phenomenon
			    of <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2017/01/13/citation-cartels-science/">"citation
			    cartels"</a> is well documented.
			  </p>
			  <p>There are also methodological challenges:
			    citations for all papers are not freely
			    available and change rapidly, and citation
			    count systems like Google Scholar do not do
			    a great job of disambiguating
			    authors <em>and</em> can be gamed by
			    authors. (See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qGuYgMsAAAAJ&hl=en">Et
			    al.'s</a> page for a humorous example.)
			  </p>
			  <p>Note that selective conferences are
			    already a proxy for citation impact:
			    papers published at these conferences are
			    on average much more highly cited than
			    papers that appear in less selective, less
			    prestigious venues.

			    A single faculty member gets 1/N credit for a paper, where N is the
			    number of authors, regardless of their affiliation or status (faculty,

			    for at most 1.0, in the case that all authors are / end up becoming

			    The key downside to counting papers
			    without adjusting for authors is that it
			    would make it trivial to inflate the
			    effect of writing a single paper simply by
			    adding authors.  Splitting authorship
			    credit means that authors are incentivized

			      <li>Authorship counts would be difficult

			      <li>Authorship counts would be dynamic
			      (that is, they would change over

			      longer in the database, everyone else
			      would have to have their credit
			      increased (talk about perverse
			      incentives).</li>
			      <li>It would create an incentive
			      for senior faculty to have their junior
			      collaborators not get tenure (since they
			      would then likely leave the
			      database).</li>
			      <li>It would favor collaboration with
			      industry (not in the database) over
			      collaboration with academics. Note that
			      companies do not
			      generally provide public access to their
			      employee directories.</li>
			      <li>It would create a disincentive for
			      faculty to see their students get
			      faculty appointments (since it would
			      reduce credit).</li>

			    a number of faculty from other departments

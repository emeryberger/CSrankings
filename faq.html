			    Currently, only three conferences are
			    listed per area.  Additional conferences
			    are not listed (a) when they are not
			    roughly equivalent to the rest in terms of
			    number of submissions, selectivity and
			    citation impact, or (b) there is no clear
			    choice among the contenders for third
			    place.
			  </p>
			  <p>For example: in the area of programming
			    languages, PLDI and POPL
			    currently get roughly 300 and 220
			    submissions each year, respectively. Their
			    acceptance rates over the last 10 years
			    are 20% and 21%, while their
			    citation impacts (measured by h5-median,
			    via Google Scholar) are 69 and 65 (higher is better).
			  </p>
			  <p>For illustration, here are the stats for
			  other conferences in this area which did not make the cut:
			    <ul>
			      <li>OOPSLA: 200 submissions / year, 25% acceptance rate, h5-median: 49.</li>
			      <li>PPoPP: 150 submissions / year, 21% acceptance rate, h5-median: 50.</li>
			      <li>ICFP: 100 submissions / year, 31% acceptance rate, h5-median: 35.</li>

			    A single faculty member gets 1/N credit for a paper, where N is the
			    number of authors, regardless of their affiliation or status (faculty,
			    student, or otherwise). The number never changes. A paper can count
			    for at most 1.0, in the case that all authors are / end up becoming
			    faculty in the database.
			  </p>
			  <p>
			    The key downside to counting papers
			    without adjusting for authors is that it
			    would make it trivial to inflate the
			    effect of writing a single paper simply by
			    adding authors.  Splitting authorship
			    credit means that authors will be
			    incentivized to
			    appropriately <a href="http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/policy_on_authorship">treat

			    Here are some of the
			    numerous downsides of only including
			    authors present in the database:

			    <ul>
			      <li>Authorship counts would be difficult
			      to calculate (manually).</li>
			      <li>Authorship counts would be dynamic
			      (that is, they would change over
			      time). When an author dies and is no
			      longer in the database, everyone else
			      would have to have their credit
			      increased (talk about perverse
			      incentives).</li>
			      <li>It would create a perverse incentive
			      for senior faculty to have their junior
			      collaborators not get tenure (since they
			      would then likely leave the
			      database).</li>
			      <li>It would favor collaboration with
			      industry (not in the database) over
			      collaboration with academics. Note that
			      for very good reasons, companies do not
			      generally provide public access to their
			      employee directories.</li>
			      <li>It would create a disincentive for
			      faculty to see their students get
			      faculty appointments (since it would
			      reduce credit).</li>
			    </ul>

			    The criteria for inclusion (which have
			    been refined since CSRankings' inception)
			    are that anyone who is a full-time,
			    tenure-track faculty member on a given
			    campus <em>who can advise PhD
			    students</em> in Computer Science can be
			    included in the database. This approach
			    thus extends the reach of the database to
			    a number of faculty from other departments
			    who have adjunct appointments with a CS
			    department or similar that let them advise
			    CS PhD students.

			    The primary audience of CSRankings is
			    prospective graduate students who are
			    seeking a postgraduate degree in Computer
			    Science. Including ECE and other
			    departments (when these are not just the
			    local name for computer science) would likely
			    sow confusion. As mentioned above,
			    tenure-track faculty who can advise PhD
			    students in CS can be included regardless
			    of their home department.

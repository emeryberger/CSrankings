			    Rankings are intensely popular and
			      influential. While we might wish for a
			      world without rankings, wishing will not
			    make rankings go away.
			  </p>
			  <p>Given this state of affairs, it makes
			      sense to aim for a ranking system that
			      is meaningful and transparent. Unfortunately, the most influential
			      rankings right now are those from US
			      News and World Report, which is entirely
			      reputation-based and <a target="_blank"
			      href="http://www.usnews.com/education/best-graduate-schools/articles/science-schools-methodology">relies
			      on surveys sent to department heads and
			      directors of graduate studies.</a>
			  </p>
			  <p>
			    By contrast, CSRankings is entirely
			    metrics-based: it weighs departments by
			    their presence at the most prestigious
			    publication venues. This approach is
			    intended to be both incentive-aligned
			    (faculty already aim to publish at top
			    venues) and difficult to game, since
			    publishing in such conferences is
			    difficult. It is admittedly bean-counting,
			    but its intent is to "count the right
			    beans." It is also entirely transparent;
			    all code and data are publicly available.

			    Unfortunately, citation-based metrics have been
			    repeatedly shown to be <a target="_blank"
			    href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.0638">easy</a>
			    to <a target="_blank"
				  href="http://evaluation.hypotheses.org/files/2010/12/pdf_IkeAntkareISSI.pdf">manipulate</a>. It costs nothing to add a citation. Sadly, there are communities that routinely cite each other in an effort to increase their perceived impact. Getting a paper into a top conference is not so easy.
			  </p>
			  <p>There are also methodological challenges:
			    citations for all papers are not freely
			    available and change rapidly, and citation
			    count systems like Google Scholar don't do
			    a great job of disambiguating
			    authors <em>and</em> can be gamed by
			    authors. (See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qGuYgMsAAAAJ&hl=en">Et
			    al.'s</a> page for a humorous example.)
			  </p>
			  <p>However, selective conferences are
			    already a proxy for citation impact:
			    papers published at these conferences are
			    on average much more highly cited than
			    papers that appear in less selective, less
			    prestigious venues.

			    A single faculty member gets 1/N credit for a paper, where N is the
			    number of authors, regardless of their affiliation or status (faculty,

			    The key downside to counting papers
			    without adjusting for authors is that it
			    would make it trivial to inflate the
			    effect of writing a single paper simply by
			    adding authors.  Splitting authorship
			    credit means that authors will be

			      <li>Authorship counts would be dynamic

			      longer in the database, everyone else
			      would have to have their credit
			      increased (talk about perverse
			      incentives).</li>
			      <li>It would create a perverse incentive
			      for senior faculty to have their junior
			      collaborators not get tenure (since they
			      would then likely leave the
			      database).</li>
			      <li>It would favor collaboration with
			      industry (not in the database) over
			      collaboration with academics. Note that
			      for very good reasons, companies do not
			      generally provide public access to their
			      employee directories.</li>
			      <li>It would create a disincentive for
			      faculty to see their students get
			      faculty appointments (since it would
			      reduce credit).</li>

			    campus <em>who can advise PhD
